title: Pivotal Cloud Foundry Security Overview and Policy
owner: Security
---

This document outlines Pivotal's security policy and is addressed to operators deploying [<%= vars.first_product_name %>](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf) using Pivotal Operations Manager.

For a comprehensive overview of the security architecture of each <%= vars.product_runtime %> component, see [PAS Security](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/concepts/security.html).

## <a id='monitor'></a> How Pivotal Monitors for Security Vulnerabilities

Pivotal receives private reports on vulnerabilities from customers and from field personnel through Pivotal's secure disclosure process. We also monitor public repositories of software security vulnerabilities to identify newly discovered vulnerabilities that might affect one or more of Pivotal's products.

### <a id='report'></a> How to Report a Vulnerability

Pivotal encourages users who become aware of a security vulnerability in Pivotal's products to contact Pivotal with details of the vulnerability. Please send descriptions of any vulnerabilities found to security@pivotal.io. Include details about the software and hardware configuration of your system so that Pivotal can reproduce the issue.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Pivotal encourages use of encrypted email. Pivotal's public PGP key is located at <a href="http://www.pivotal.io/security">http://www.pivotal.io/security</a>.</p>


## <a id='notification-policy'></a> Notification Policy

<%= vars.product_name %> has many customer stakeholders who need to know about security updates. When there is a possible security vulnerability identified for an <%= vars.product_name %> component, Pivotal does the following:

1. Assess the impact to <%= vars.product_name %>.

1. If the vulnerability would affect an <%= vars.product_name %> component, Pivotal schedules an update for the impacted component(s).

1. Update the affected component(s) and perform system tests.

1. Announce the fix publicly through the following channels:
  1. Automated notification to end users who have downloaded or subscribed to an <%= vars.product_name %> product on [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io) when a new, fixed version is available.
  1. Adding a new post to [http://www.pivotal.io/security](http://www.pivotal.io/security).


## <a id='classes'></a> Classes of Vulnerabilities

Attackers can exploit vulnerabilities to compromise user data and processing resources. This can affect data confidentiality, integrity, and availability to different degrees. For vulnerabilities related to Ubuntu provided packages, Pivotal follows [Canonical's priority levels](http://people.canonical.com/~ubuntu-security/cve/priority.html). For other vulnerabilities, Pivotal follows [Common Vulnerability Scoring System v3.0 standards](https://www.first.org/cvss/specification-document) when assessing severity.

Pivotal uses Canonical's Ubuntu distribution of Linux for <%= vars.product_name %> Ubuntu stemcells and rootfs. Canonical provides Pivotal with support services allowing Pivotal to escalate CVEs that Pivotal determine might affect <%= vars.product_name %>. In general, Pivotal does not escalate to upstream open source software components or vendors for Medium or Low CVEs that are not yet patched. <%= vars.product_name %> can escalate on behalf of a customer for High or Critical CVEs. <%= vars.product_name %> customers who are interested in addressing CVEs in Ubuntu that are not yet patched can establish their own support relationship with [Canonical](https://www.ubuntu.com/support).

Pivotal reports the severity of vulnerabilities using the following severity classes:

### <a id='high'></a> High

High severity vulnerabilities are those that can be exploited by an unauthenticated or authenticated attacker, from the Internet or those that break the guest/host Operating System isolation. The exploitation could result in the complete compromise of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of user data and/or processing resources without user interaction. Exploitation could be leveraged to propagate an Internet worm or execute arbitrary code between Virtual Machines and/or the Host Operating System. This rating also applies to those vulnerabilities that could lead to the complete compromise of availability when the exploitation is by a remote unauthenticated attacker from the Internet or through a breach of virtual machine isolation.

### <a id='moderate'></a> Moderate

Moderate vulnerabilities are those in which the ability to exploit is mitigated to a significant degree by configuration or difficulty of exploitation, but in certain deployment scenarios could still lead to the compromise of confidentiality, integrity, or availability of user data and/or processing resources.

### <a id='low'></a> Low

Low vulnerabilities are all other issues that have a security impact. These include vulnerabilities for which exploitation is believed to be extremely difficult, or for which successful exploitation would have minimal impact.


## <a id='release-policy'></a> Release Policy

<%= vars.product_name %> schedules regular monthly releases of software in the <%= vars.product_name %> Suite to address Low / Medium severity vulnerability exploits. When High severity vulnerability exploits are identified, <%= vars.product_name %> releases fixes to software in the <%= vars.product_name %> Suite on-demand, with as fast a turnaround as possible.
