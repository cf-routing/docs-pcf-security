This topic describes how to check the expiration date of and rotate certificate authorities (CAs) and leaf certificates in <%= vars.product_name_full %> (<%= vars.product_name %>).

This includes the <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA, BOSH NATS CA, and leaf certificates in <%= vars.product_name %>) that are visible to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API.

<p class='note warning'><strong>Warning:</strong> The rotation procedures described in this topic do not work if the certificates have already expired. If the certificates have expired, contact <a href="https://support.pivotal.io/">Pivotal Support</a> for guidance.</p>

For information about rotating IPsec certificates, see [Rotating IPsec Certificates](https://docs.pivotal.io/addon-ipsec/credentials.html).


## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

The <%= vars.ops_manager %> API manages and lists internal CAs and leaf certificates that enable <%= vars.product_name %> components to communicate with each other securely using TLS. It can also list certificates used externally, such as SAML certificates that authenticate to an external identity provider (IDP).

Rotate CAs and leaf certificates before they expire to avoid downtime for your foundation.


## <a id='types'></a> Certificate Types

PCF uses a root CA and various leaf certificates. Root CAs are self-signed certificates that issue leaf certificates. Root CAs can be generated by Pivotal or custom. 

Leaf certificates are signed by a CA and are used to identify resources in PCF. Both root CAs and leaf certificates require planned rotation in PCF.

The following types of <%= vars.product_name %> certificates require planned rotation:

* **Ops Manager Root CA**: The Ops Manager root CA issues other certificates that <%= vars.product_name %> uses. The root CA can be a Pivotal-generated CA or your own custom CA. The Ops Manager root CA expires four years after creation. For more information about viewing the root CAs for Ops Manager, see [Listing the Root Certificate Authorities](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsman-api/#listing-the-root-certificate-authorities). 

* **Other internal CAs**: The following CAs are used primarily for internal purposes: 
  * **BOSH NATS CA**: The BOSH NATS CA is rotated automatically when you rotate the Ops Manager root CA. The BOSH NATS CA is rotatable in PCF v2.3.10 or later, PCF v2.4.4 or later, and PCF v2.5 or later. For more information, see [2.3.10](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html#2-3-10) in _Ops Manager v2.3 Release Notes_ and [2.4.4](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-4/pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html#2-4-4) in _Ops Manager v2.4 Release Notes_.
  * **BOSH DNS CAs**: The BOSH DNS CAs are applied automatically when you upgrade to PCF v2.3. You cannot rotate the BOSH DNS CAs. To apply all BOSH DNS leaf certificates after upgrading to v2.3, you must rotate all certificates in your environment. For more information, see [BOSH DNS Certificate Authority Upgrades](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/pcf-release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html#bosh-dns-certs) in _Ops Manager v2.3 Release Notes_.

* **Non-configurable Certificates**: Non-configurable certificates are leaf certificates either created by a CA stored in Ops Manager, or created and stored by CredHub and managed by Ops Manager calls to the CredHub API. Non-configurable certificates are issued directly by the Ops Manager root CA, or by intermediate CAs in a chain of trust originated by the root CA. Non-configurable certificates expire after two years. For more information about about viewing non-configurable leaf certificates, see [Getting Information About Certificates for Products](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsman-api/#getting-information-about-certificates-from-products). For more information about generating non-configurable leaf certificates, see [Generating New Certificates](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsman-api/#generating-new-certificates). 

* **Configurable Certificates**: Configurable certificates are leaf certificates supplied by the user and pasted into configuration fields in Ops Manager. Some configuration panes include a **Generate RSA Certificate** button that supplies valid certificates, but users can obtain configurable certificates from elsewhere. Configurable certificates generated by Ops Manager typically expire after two years. For more information about viewing configurable leaf certificates, see [Getting Information About Certificates for Products](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsman-api/#getting-information-about-certificates-from-products).

* **Non-rotatable Certificates**: Non-rotatable certificates are leaf certificates that, like non-configurable certificates, are issued by the root CA. Unlike non-configurable certificates, non-rotatable certificates cannot be rotated by the Ops Manager API. For more information about viewing non-rotatable leaf certificates, see [Getting Information About Certificates for Products](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/opsman-api/#getting-information-about-certificates-from-products).opsman-api/#getting-information-about-certificates-from-products).

In addition to the types of certificates listed above, some Pivotal products issue their own tile certificates that are not managed by or visible to the Ops Manager API. These tile certificates do not require planned rotation because they rotate automatically with product upgrades.

Pivotal Application Service (PAS) and Pivotal Container Service (PKS) both use tile certificates in addition to their Ops Manager certificates.


## <a id='check-and-rotate'></a> Master Procedure: Check and Rotate Certificates

The following master procedure checks expiration dates of different types of internal certificates and rotates them only as necessary. You can run this procedure only when records show that your certificates will expire soon, or else periodically to comply your organization's security compliance policies.

To check and rotate certificates:

1. Follow the [Check Ops Manager Root CA Expiration Date](#root-expiry) procedure and record your root CA expiration date.

1. Follow the [Check Leaf Certificate Expiration Dates](#leaf-expiry) procedure and record any leaf certificates that are expiring soon.

1. Follow the [Identify Non-Configurable, Configurable, and Unrotatable Leaf Certificates](#id-leaf-type) to determine which types of leaf certificates require rotation.

1. Do the following to rotate certificates as necessary:
  1. If you have any non-rotatable certificates expiring soon, call [Pivotal Support](http://support.pivotal.io).
  1. If your root CA expires soon, follow the [Rotate Root and Leaf Certificates](#rotate-ca) procedure.
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> If you also have configurable leaf certificates expiring soon, Pivotal recommends that you follow the procedure in <a href="#rotate-config-after-new-root">Rotate Configurable Certificates</a>. You can also rotate your configurable certificates separately and re-deploy later.</p>
  1. If you have non-configurable leaf certificates expiring soon, but not your root CA, follow the [Rotate Non-Configurable Certificates](#regenerate) procedure.
  1. If you have configurable leaf certificates expiring soon, but not your root CA, follow the [Rotate Configurable Certificates](#rotate-config) procedure.


## <a id='checks'></a> Check Expiration Dates and Certificate Types

This section describes how to check the expiration dates of the CAs and leaf certificates that the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API lists and manages. It also explains how to identify the types of certificates that require manual rotation.

After identifying the types of certificates that expire soon, you can determine which certificate rotation procedure to follow.

### <a id='root-expiry'></a> Check Ops Manager Root CA Expiration Date

This procedure describes how to check the expiration date for the <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA. The <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA expires four years after creation.

To check the <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA expiration date:

1. Follow the procedure in [Using <%= vars.ops_manager %> API](../../customizing/ops-man-api.html) to target and authenticate with the <%= vars.ops_manager %> User Account and Authentication (UAA) server. Record your <%= vars.ops_manager %> access token, and use it for `YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` in the steps below.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When you record your <%= vars.ops_manager %> access token, remove any newline characters such as <code>\n</code>.</p>

1. To retrieve the Ops Manager root CA, use `curl` to make an Ops Manager API call to the `https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities` endpoint. For example:
    <pre class='terminal'>
    $ curl "https<span>:</span>//OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities" \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
    </pre>

1. To make the JSON output more readable, you can pipe it to [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) or another text editor with JSON formatting.

1. In the `certificate_authorities` list returned, if there is more than one, find the CA with `"active": true`.

1. To determine the expiration date of the active CA, refer to its `expires_on` value. For example, the root CA shown below expires on September 5, 2019:
    <pre class='terminal'>
{
  "certificate_authorities": [
    {
      "guid": "9c9a110c8f82a1e4aaca",
      "issuer": "Pivotal",
      "created_on": "2017-09-05T22:47:53Z",
      "expires_on": "2019-09-05T22:47:53Z",
      "active": true,
      "cert_pem": "\-\-\-\-\-BEGIN CERTIFICATE\-\-\-\-\-\
      [...]
      \n-----END CERTIFICATE\-\-\-\-\-\n"
    </pre>

### <a id='leaf-expiry'></a> Check Leaf Certificate Expiration Dates

This procedure describes how to check the expiration dates of non-configurable and configurable leaf certificates. Non-configurable leaf certificates expire after two years. Configurable leaf certificates generated by Ops Manager also typically expire after two years.

To check the expiration dates of leaf certificates and identify the types of leaf certificates that expire soon:

1. If you have not already done so, follow the procedure in [Using <%= vars.ops_manager %> API](../../customizing/ops-man-api.html) to target and authenticate with the <%= vars.ops_manager %> UAA server. Record your <%= vars.ops_manager %> access token, and use it for `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` in the following steps.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When you record your <%= vars.ops_manager %> access token, remove any newline characters such as <code>\n</code>.</p>

1. To check the system for certificates that expire within a given time interval, use `curl` to call the `https://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/certificates?expires_within=TIME` API endpoint, replacing `TIME` with an integer-letter code.
    Valid letter codes are `d` for days, `w` for weeks, `m` for months, and `y` for years.<br><br>
    For example, the following command searches for certificates expiring within six months:
    <pre>
    $ curl "https<span>:</span>//OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/deployed/certificates?expires_within=6m" \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
    </pre>
    Replace `YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` with the <code>access_token</code> value you recorded in the previous step.

1. To make the JSON output more readable, you can pipe it to [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/) or another text editor with JSON formatting.

1. To determine the expiration date of each certificate, refer to its `expires_on` value.

1. Continue to [Rotate Certificates](#rotate) with your list of certificate types that expire soon.


## <a id='rotate'></a> Rotate Certificates

Output from the `deployed/certificates` endpoint, such as the output generated in the [Check Leaf Certificate Expiration Dates](#leaf-expiry) procedure, combines information about non-configurable, configurable, and unrotatable leaf certificates into a single list.

You must manually rotate the different leaf certificate types in different ways. 

The following rules identify the type of each leaf certificate requiring rotation:

* **Non-Rotatable Certificates**: Non-Rotatable leaf certificates have the following property value:
  - `variable_path` is `/opsmgr/bosh_dns/tls_ca`  

    If you have non-rotatable certificates expiring soon, call [Pivotal Support](https://support.pivotal.io).

* **Non-Configurable Certificates**: Non-Configurable leaf certificates have the following property values, but are not non-rotatable as identified above:
  - `configurable` is `false`
  - `location` is either `ops_manager` or `credhub`

* **Configurable Certificates**: Configurable leaf certificates have the following property value:
  - `configurable` is `true`


## <a id='rotate'></a> Rotate CAs and Leaf Certificates

The following procedures rotate the Ops Manager root CA, BOSH NATS CA, and leaf certificates that are listed or managed by the Ops Manager API.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The rotation procedures described in this topic does not work when your certificates have already expired.  If your certificates have expired, contact <a href="https://support.pivotal.io/">Pivotal Support</a> for guidance.</p>

### <a id='rotate-ca'></a> Rotate Root and Leaf Certificates

This procedure uses the Ops Manager API to rotate the Ops Manager root CA, the BOSH NATS CA, and the intermediate CAs and non-configurable leaf certificates underneath them.

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The BOSH NATS CA is automatically rotated when you rotate the Ops Manager root CA. For more information, see <a href="#types">Certificate Types</a>.</p>

Rotating the Ops Manager root CA automatically rotates all configurable leaf certificates. You can also rotate configurable leaf certificates separately from rotating the root CA. For information about rotating configurable leaf certificates without also rotating the root CA, see [Rotate Configurable Certificates](#rotate-config).

PCF users never need to manually rotate intermediate CAs, because they rotate automatically when the root CA is rotated.

To prevent system downtime, this procedure includes two BOSH redeploys. When you click **Apply Changes** for the first time, BOSH applies new certificates to PCF components alongside the old ones. The second **Apply Changes** then deletes the old certificates. Each successful redeploy verifies that the certificate rotation process is proceeding correctly.

<p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The names of the <strong>Upgrade All Service Instances</strong> and <strong>Recreate All Service Instances</strong> errands may be slightly different between services.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> You must complete these steps in the exact order specified. Otherwise, you may damage your deployment.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you use mutual TLS for route integrity, do not attempt to rotate certificate authorities (CAs). Instead, contact <a href="https://support.pivotal.io">Pivotal Support</a>. For more information, see <a href="https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/pcf-release-notes/runtime-rn.html#cert-rotation-with-mutual-tls-route-integrity">Certificate Authority Rotation is Not Working in Some PAS Configurations</a>.</p>

#### <a id='add-new-ca'></a> Step 1: Add a New Root CA

This section describes how to add a new root CA for <%= vars.ops_manager %>. The new root CA can be a Pivotal-generated CA or your own custom CA.

To add a new root CA for <%= vars.ops_manager %> and regenerate the BOSH NATS CA:

1. If you have not already done so, perform the steps in the [Using Ops Manager API](../../customizing/ops-man-api.html) topic to target and authenticate with the Ops Manager User Account and Authentication (UAA) server. Record your Ops Manager access token, and use it for `YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` in the following procedures.
  <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> When you record your Ops Manager access token, remove any newline characters such as <code>\n</code>.</p>

1. Use Ops Manager to generate a new CA, or else add your own custom CA. 
  <p class ="note"><strong>Note:</strong> Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (ECDSA) certificates are not supported in PCF.</p>
  * **To use your own custom CA**, call the Ops Manager API `certificate_authorities` endpoint as follows:
    <pre>
      curl "http<span>s:</span>//OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities" \
          -X POST \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{"cert_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\YOUR-CERTIFICATE", "private_key_pem": "-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----\YOUR-KEY"}'
    </pre>
    Where:
    <ul><li>`YOUR-CERTIFICATE` is your custom CA.</li> 
      <li>`YOUR-KEY` is your RSA key.</li>
      <li>`YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.</li></ul><p>If the command succeeds, the API returns a response that includes the new CA certificate:</p> 
    <pre class="terminal">
      HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      {
        "certificate_authorities": [
          {
            "guid": "f7bc18f34f2a7a9403c3",
            "issuer": "YOUR-CA",
            "created_on": "2017-01-09",
            "expires_on": "2021-01-09",
            "active": true,
            "cert_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIC+zCCAeOgAwIBAgI....etc"
          }
        ]
      }
    </pre>
  * **To use a Pivotal-generated CA**, call the Ops Manager API `generate` endpoint as follows:
    <pre>
    $ curl "http<span>s</span>://OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities/generate" \
          -X POST \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{}'
    </pre>
    If the command succeeds, the API returns a response that includes the new CA certificate:
    <pre class="terminal">
          HTTP/1.1 200 OK
      {
          "guid": "f7bc18f34f2a7a9403c3",

    </pre>

1. Confirm that your new CA has been added by listing all of the root CAs for Ops Manager:
  <pre>
  $ curl "http<span>s:</span>//OPS-MAN-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities" \
        -X GET \
        -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR-UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
  </pre>
      The API call returns the GUID of the newly added CA. For example:
  <pre class="terminal">
    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    {
      "certificate_authorities": [
        {
          "guid": "f7bc18f34f2a7a9403c3",
          "issuer": "Pivotal",
          "created_on": "2017-01-09",
          "expires_on": "2021-01-09",
          "active": true,
          "cert_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\nMIIC+zCCAeOgAwIBAgI....etc"
        }
        {
          "guid": "a8ee01e33e3e3e3303e3",
          "issuer": "Pivotal",
          "created_on": "2017-04-09",
          "expires_on": "2021-04-09",
          "active": false,
          "cert_pem": "-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----\zBBBC+eAAAe1gAwAAAeZ....etc"
        }
      ]
    }
  </pre>

1. Identify the newly added CA, which has `active` set to `false`. Record its GUID.

1. Navigate to `https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` in a browser, where `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the FQDN of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.

1. Click the **BOSH Director** tile in the **Installation Dashboard**.

1. Select the **Director Config** pane.

1. Select **Recreate All VMs**. This propagates the new CA to all VMs to prevent downtime.

1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.

1. If you have service tiles installed, for each service tile:
    1. Click the tile.
    1. Click the **Errands** tab.
    1. Enable the **Upgrade All Service Instances** errand. Running this errand is necessary to push CredHub certificate updates to each service instance.
    1. If the service tile has the **Recreate All Service Instances** errand:
        1. Enable the **Recreate All Service Instances** errand.
        1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
        1. Click **Apply Changes**.
    1. If the service tile does not have the **Recreate All Service Instances** errand:
        1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
        1. Click **Apply Changes**.
        1. When the deploy finishes, manually push the BOSH NATS CA to each of its service instances. For each service instance, run:

            ```
            bosh -d SERVICE-INSTANCE-DEPLOYMENT recreate
            ```
            Where `SERVICE-INSTANCE-DEPLOYMENT` is the BOSH deployment name for the service instance.
            
1. If you do not have any service tiles installed:
    1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
    1. Click **Apply Changes**.

1. When the deploy finishes and you have completed all necessary tasks to update service instances, continue to the next section, [Activate Root CA](#activate-new-ca).

#### <a id='activate-new-ca'></a> Step 2: Activate Root CA

To activate the new root CA:

1. Make an <%= vars.ops_manager %> API call that activates the new CAs. Run:

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities/CERTIFICATE-GUID/activate" \
      -X POST \
      -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
      -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
      -d '{}'
    ```
    Where:
    * `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the FQDN of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.
    * `CERTIFICATE-GUID` is the GUID of your CA that you retrieved in the previous section.
    * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.
    </br>
    </br>
  The API returns a successful response:
  <pre class="terminal">HTTP/1.1 200 OK</pre>

1. List your root CAs again to confirm that the new <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA is active. Run:

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities" \
          -X GET \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
    ```
    Where:
    * `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the FQDN of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.
    * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.

1. Examine the response to ensure that your new CA has the `active` property set to `true`.

#### <a id='rotate-config-after-new-root'></a> Step 3: Rotate Configurable Leaf Certificates

Any configurable certificates generated from the <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA must be rotated. These are the certificates that you generated using **Generate RSA Certificate** in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> UI. For example, see [Providing a Certificate for Your TLS Termination Point](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-3/opsguide/security_config.html).

To regenerate and rotate configurable leaf certificates, do the following for each configurable certificate that expires soon:

1. Find the text field where the certificate is configured within the <%= vars.ops_manager %> interface. You might need to look through multiple configuration panes to identify the location of the certificate configuration text field. Use the following fields to identify the location of the certificate configuration text field:
  * The `product_guid` field in the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API output can help identify in which tile the certificate is configured. For example, the prefix `p-bosh-` refers to the BOSH Director tile, and the prefix `cf-` refers to the <%= vars.product_runtime %> (<%= vars.product_short %>) tile.
  * The `property_reference` field in the API output can help identify in which **Settings** pane the certificate is configured. For example, the `uaa.service_provider_key_credentials` property is configured in the **UAA** pane of the <%= vars.product_short %> tile.

1. Copy a new value for the certificate into the text field or generate a new certificate using the
**Generate RSA Certificate** button.

1. Click **Save** at the bottom of each pane in which you added new certificates.

#### <a id='regenerate-from-new-root'></a> Step 4: Rotate Non-Configurable Leaf Certificates from the New CAs

After activating the new <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA, you must rotate non-configurable leaf certificates from the root CA.

To rotate non-configurable leaf certificates from the new root CA:

1. Make a call to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API to regenerate all non-configurable certificates and apply the new root CA to your existing BOSH Director. Run:

    ```
      curl "https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities/active/regenerate" \

1. When the deploy finishes and you have completed all necessary tasks to update service instances, continue to the next section, [Delete the Old Root CA](#delete).

#### <a id='delete'></a> Step 5: Delete the Old Root CA

After activating new CAs and rotating leaf certificates from the new CAs, you should delete the old <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA from your foundation.

If your old root CA or leaf certificates have been compromised, you must delete the old root CA immediately. Otherwise, the old root CA and its leaf certificates may still be trusted, which compromises your foundation's security. If your old root CA or leaf certificates have not been compromised, <%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends that you delete the old root CA as soon as possible, but you can also delete it at a later time, such as in conjunction with another deploy.

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> Before you delete the old CA, ensure that you reviewed the <strong>Review Pending Changes</strong> page and clicked <strong>Apply Changes</strong> as part of <a href="#regenerate-from-new-root">Rotate Non-Configurable Leaf Certificates from the New CAs</a>.</p>

To delete the old <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA:

1. List your root CAs to retrieve the GUID of the old, inactive <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA. Run:

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities" \
          -X GET \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
    ```
    Where:
    * `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the FQDN of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.
    * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.

1. Use `curl` to make an API call to delete the old <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA. Run:

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities/OLD-CERTIFICATE-GUID" \
          -X DELETE \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN"
    ```
    Where:
    * `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the FQDN of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.
    * `OLD-CERTIFICATE-GUID` is the GUID of the old <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA.
    * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.

### <a id='regenerate'></a> Rotate Non-Configurable Leaf Certificates

This procedure rotates non-configurable leaf certificates visible to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API, whether they are managed and stored by <%= vars.ops_manager %> directly, or by CredHub at <%= vars.ops_manager %>'s request.

<p class='note warning'><strong>Warning:</strong> This procedure does not rotate the <%= vars.ops_manager %> root CA. To rotate both the root CA and non-configurable leaf certificates, see <a href="#rotate-ca">Rotate CAs and Leaf Certificates</a>.</p>

To rotate non-configurable leaf certificates:

1. Make a call to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API to regenerate all non-configurable certificates and apply the new CA to your existing BOSH Director. Run:

    ```
    curl "https://OPS-MANAGER-FQDN/api/v0/certificate_authorities/active/regenerate" \
          -X POST \
          -H "Authorization: Bearer UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN" \
          -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
          -d '{}'
    ```
    Where:
    * `OPS-MANAGER-FQDN` is the FQDN of your <%= vars.ops_manager %> deployment.
    * `UAA-ACCESS-TOKEN` is your UAA access token.

### <a id='rotate-config'></a> Rotate Configurable Leaf Certificates

Configurable certificates are generated by the user and copied into Ops Manager configuration panes where needed. Examples include certificates that terminate SSL traffic into PAS, or authenticate a Single Sign-On (SSO) service plan to an external SAML server.

For specific instructions to rotate SAML certificates for both PAS and the SSO service, see [Identity Provider SAML Certificates](#rotate-saml-ca). These certificates expire every two years, and every IdP has its own certificate that may require its own rotation cadence.

For Ops Manager, PAS, and other runtimes, Pivotal recommends only rotating configurable certificates within the more inclusive [Rotate Root and Leaf Certificates](#rotate-ca) procedure. If you are sure that only your configurable certificates need rotation, and no others, you can run this procedure by itself and click **Apply Changes** at the end.

To rotate configurable leaf certificates:

1. If you have not already done so, use the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API `deployed/certificates` endpoint to retrieve information about your expiring configurable certificates, as described in the procedures in [Check Expiration Dates and Certificate Types](#checks). The information for each configurable certificate looks like the following example:
  <pre class="terminal">
    {
      "configurable": true,
      "property_reference": ".properties.networking_poe_ssl_certs[0].certificate",
      "property_type": "rsa_cert_credentials",
      "product_guid": "cf-36066831c119c39736d3",
      ...
      "valid_until": "2019-01-25T22:07:58Z"
    },
  </pre>

1. For each configurable certificate that expires soon:
  1. Find the text field the certificate is configured within the Ops Manager interface.
      * The `product_guid` field in the API output can help identify which tile the certificate is configured in. For example, the prefix `p-bosh-` refers to the BOSH Director tile, and the prefix `cf-` refers to the PAS tile.
      * The `property_reference` field in the API output can often help identify which **Settings** pane the certificate is configured in. For example, the `uaa.service_provider_key_credentials` property is configured in the PAS tile > **UAA** pane.
      * You might have to look through multiple configuration panes to identify where a certificate is configured.
  2. Paste a new value for the certificate into the field
  3. Click **Save** at the bottom of each pane in which you have provided new certificates.

1. If you are rotating configurable certificates within the [Rotate CAs and Leaf Certificates](#rotate-ca) procedure, continue to the next step. Otherwise, if you are rotating configurable leaf certificates only:
  1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.
  1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
  1. Click **Apply Changes**.

### <a id='rotate-saml-ca'></a> Rotate Identity Provider SAML Certificates

SAML service provider credentials are one example of configurable certificates in PCF. When PAS is configured to use SAML as an identity provider, it uses a configurable CA certificate to authenticate to an external SAML server, by generating ephemeral certificates that PAS includes in its outbound request message headers. This CA has a two-year expiration period.

In addition, the SSO service shares the use of PAS SAML certificates for every SAML external Identity Provider integration, such as trust, partnership, or federation. You must rotate these in lockstep with PAS.

The following procedure provides an example of how to rotate certificates for each IDP, including temporarily disabling certificate validation on the IDP side during the rotation.

For more information about rotating SAML certificates, see [PCF Advisory - SAML Service Provider Credential Certificates Expire after 2 Years](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/PCF-Advisory---SAML-Service-Provider-Credential-Certificates-Expire-after-2-Years) in the Pivotal Knowledge Base.

SAML service provider credentials are only required for your PAS deployment if all of these conditions are met:

* You are using SSO in production for login to PAS or using the SSO service for login to apps.

* You are using SAML identity providers for PAS or SSO service plans.

* You had Ops Manager generate a certificate for you by clicking the **Generate RSA Certificate** button.

* You are validating the signature of SAML authentication request with your identity provider.

To regenerate and rotate SAML service provider certificates without disrupting PAS or your apps using the SSO service:

1. Disable certificate validation in your identity provider.

1. For PAS, follow the procedure in the table below that corresponds to your use case. This includes downloading and importing a new certificate and updated SAML metadata in your identity provider.
