title: Accessing BOSH CredHub with the CredHub CLI
owner: Ops Manager
---

This topic provides the procedure for accessing BOSH CredHub with the CredHub CLI.

For example, you may need to access BOSH CredHub to rotate the Services TLS CA and its leaf certificates.
For more information, see [Rotating the Services TLS CA and Its Leaf Certificates]
(services_tls_ca_rotate.html).

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview

<%= vars.ops_manager %> stores some of its internal CA (certificate authority) and
non-CA certificates in the BOSH CredHub credentials store.
For more information, see [BOSH CredHub](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/credhub/#bosh).

To access the BOSH CredHub credentials store, you must retrieve
credentials from the BOSH Director and then use the credentials
to log in to CredHub from the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM.

## <a id="credhub"></a> Procedure

To access BOSH CredHub:

1. In the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard, click the **BOSH Director** tile.

1. Click the **Credentials** tab.

1. In the **BOSH Director** section, click the link to the **BOSH Commandline Credentials**.

1. Record the values for `BOSH_CLIENT` and `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET`.<br>
  For example:

    ```
    {"credential":"BOSH_CLIENT=ops_manager
    BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET=abCdE1FgHIjkL2m3n-3PqrsT4EUVwXy5
    BOSH_CA_CERT=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    BOSH_ENVIRONMENT=10.0.0.5 bosh "}
    ```
  The `BOSH_CLIENT` is the BOSH CredHub client name and the `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET` is
  the BOSH CredHub client secret.

1. Follow the procedure in
[Gather Credential and IP Address Information](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#gather)
to obtain the information needed to log in to the BOSH Director VM.
Record the IP address for the BOSH Director and the Director Credentials.

1. Log in to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM by following the procedure in
[Log in to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM with SSH](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/customizing/trouble-advanced.html#ssh).

1. From the <%= vars.ops_manager %> VM, set the API target of the CredHub CLI to your BOSH
CredHub server by running the following command:

    ```
    credhub api  \
    https://BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP:8844 \
    --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root_ca_certificate
    ```
  Where `BOSH-DIRECTOR-IP` is the IP address of the BOSH Director VM you recorded above.
  <br><br>
  For example:
  <pre class="terminal">$ credhub api \
    http<span>s:</span>//10.0.0.5:8844 \
    --ca-cert=/var/tempest/workspaces/default/root\_ca\_certificate</pre>

1. Log in to CredHub by running the following command:

    ```
    credhub login \
    --client-name=CREDHUB-CLIENT-NAME \
    --client-secret=CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET
    ```
    Where:<br>
    * `CREDHUB-CLIENT-NAME` is the value you recorded for `BOSH_CLIENT` earlier in this procedure.
    * `CREDHUB-CLIENT-SECRET` is the value you recorded for `BOSH_CLIENT_SECRET` earlier in this procedure.

    For example:
    <pre class="terminal">$ credhub login \
    --client-name=credhub \
    --client-secret=abcdefghijklm123456789</pre>
