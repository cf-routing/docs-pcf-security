title: Troubleshooting Safety Violations During Certificate Rotation
owner: CredHub
---

This topic provides operators with information on how to troubleshoot any errors that are returned when rotating certificates with either the Ops Manager API or CredHub Maestro CLI.

## <a id="overview"></a> Overview of CredHub Maestro Safety Checks

CredHub Maestro performs basic safety checks when rotating certificates to prevent unsafe operations. 

The Ops Manager API invokes CredHub Maestro when rotating certificates. If a certificate rotation API command is unsafe, CredHub Maestro stops the command and returns one or more safety violations.

CredHub Maestro returns safety violations if a rotation step is run out of order. For example, you generate a new root certificate authority (CA) but attempt to activate it before clicking **Apply Changes**. Performing steps out of the correct order during certificate rotations can make your deployment unstable or risk downtime.

### <a id="reqs"></a> Safety Checks in Ops Manager API Calls

To activate the CredHub Maestro safety checks in Ops Manager API calls, you need:

* Ops Manager v2.10 or later 
* Pivotal Application Service (PAS) v2.8 or TAS for VMs v2.9 or later 
* No installation of Pivotal Container Service (PKS) or Tanzu Kubernetes Grid Integrated Edition (TKGI)

If you are using an earlier version of PAS or have any version of PKS or TKGI installed, Ops Manager still runs safety checks, but they are not as comprehensive as the CredHub Maestro safety checks.

### <a id="skip-checks"></a> Skip Safety Checks

To skip CredHub Maestro safety checks, you can pass the `skip_safety_check` parameter to the Ops Manager API endpoints for certificate rotation. This parameter automatically appends the `--skip-safety-check` flag to the CredHub Maestro CLI commands that Ops Manager runs during the certificate rotation. 

Skipping the safety checks allows you to rotate your certificates if absolutely necessary. For example, if your CA has already expired and your apps are experiencing downtime, skipping safety checks allows you to bring your apps back faster.

## <a id="error_ref"></a> Certificate Rotation Safety Violations

This section lists known safety violations that may occur when using the Ops Manager API or CredHub Maestro CLI to rotate certificates. Each table includes the literal safety violation message, describes the safety violation, and presents possible solutions to resolving the underyling cause.

      <li>In the command line output, if the <code>signs</code> field contains a child certificate that has two versions set to <code>active: true</code> with different product tile deployment names, then do the following:

    <td>
      Continue with the certificate rotation procedure. In most cases, this means applying changes. Do not run earlier commands after the rotation process has started.
      <br/><br/>
      If you believe you are running the steps in the correct order, it is possible that a new CA has been created in CredHub after the rotation process has begun. 
      <br/><br/>
      To work around this situation, take one of the following actions: 
      <ul>
      <li>If the CA is new, exclude this CA in the <code>maestro update-transitional signing</code> step and future steps until the rotation is complete.
      <li>If you need to rotate the CA now, re-run the earlier Maestro rotation steps, but only include the CAs that were not originally present. This will get all targeted CAs into the same state. Then, run the <code>maestro update-transitional signing</code> step again.</li>

    It is possible that you are attempting to halt a rotation in the early stages, likely after new transitional CAs have been issued but not yet used. Continue with the rotation at this point.
