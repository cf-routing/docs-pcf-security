title: Advanced Certificate Rotation with CredHub Maestro
owner: CredHub Maestro
---

This topic describes how to rotate certificates and certificate authorities (CAs) in BOSH CredHub using CredHub Maestro. The topic only covers rotating CredHub-managed certificates.

For more information about setting up and using CredHub Maestro, see [Getting Started with CredHub Maestro](getting-started-with-maestro-cli.html).


## <a id='when-to-use'></a> When to Use CredHub Maestro for Certificate Rotation

<%= vars.company_name %> recommends that you use the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API to perform bulk rotation of certificates. For more information, see [Rotating Certificates](api-cert-rotation.html).

However, there are some cases when you cannot use the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API to do bulk certificate rotation. In these cases, you can use CredHub Maestro to rotate certificates.

The following describes when to use CredHub Maestro instead of the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API for certificate rotation:

* You have <%= vars.k8s_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %>) installed and therefore cannot use the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API to rotate CredHub-managed certificates.

* You have a version of <%= vars.app_runtime_full %> (<%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>) earlier than <%= vars.v_major_version %> installed and therefore cannot use the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API to rotate CredHub-managed certificates.

* You need to rotate one or more specific CredHub-managed certificates and do not want to rotate any other certificates managed by <%= vars.ops_manager %> or CredHub.


## <a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Before you rotate CredHub-managed certificates with CredHub Maestro:

* Before rotating certificates in <%= vars.ops_manager %> <%= vars.v_major_version %>, you must reset any certificates that were manually set in CredHub on <%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.6 and earlier to prevent them from being rotated with other certificates generated by CredHub. To find and reset any manually set certificates in CredHub, follow the procedure in [Reviewing Manually Set Certificates in CredHub](manual-credhub-certificate.html). For more information, see [Reset Manually Set Certificates in CredHub Before Rotating Certificates](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/2-9/release-notes/opsmanager-rn.html#credhub-generated-field) in _<%= vars.ops_manager %> v2.9 Release Notes_.

* To ensure that there is no app availability downtime during a rotation, <%= vars.company_name %> recommends that you scale up all instance groups and use an external blobstore.

* Check which tiles in your installation support certificate rotation with CredHub Maestro.
  Not every tile currently supports certificate rotation, so there is a potential for downtime.
  For more information about which tiles support certificate rotation,
  see [CredHub Maestro Tile Compatibility](maestro-tile-compatibility.html).
  <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> Using CredHub Maestro to rotate CredHub-managed certificates might cause downtime for your deployment. However, you must use CredHub Maestro in a deployment with <%= vars.k8s_runtime_abbr %> installed, since you cannot rotate CredHub-managed certificates using the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API. You can still use the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API to rotate certificates stored in <%= vars.ops_manager %>.</p>

<p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> <%= vars.company_name %> recommends that you rotate certificates with both <%= vars.ops_manager %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> and <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> <%= vars.v_major_version %> already installed. You can follow this procedure if you are using an earlier version of <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %>, but you may experience app downtime.</p>

## <a id='check-expiration'></a> Check Expiration Dates and Certificate Types

This section describes how to manually check the expiration dates of the CAs and leaf certificates managed by CredHub.

After identifying the types of certificates that expire soon, you can determine which certificate rotation procedure to follow.

To check certificate expiration dates and types:

1. Retrieve a list of certificates expiring within a given timeframe by running:

    ```
    maestro list --expires-within TIME-PERIOD
    ```
    Where `TIME-PERIOD` is the unit for which you want to check the expiry window. Valid units are `d` for days, `w` for weeks, `m` for months, and `y` for years.

1. After you identify the list of certificates that expire soon, follow the procedure in [Rotate Certificates](#rotate-certs).


## <a id='rotate-certs'></a> Rotate Certificates

This section explains how to rotate leaf certificates and CAs stored in CredHub. There are different rotation procedures for each type of certificate that requires rotation.

You can determine which rotation procedure to follow based on the types of certificates in your foundation that must be rotated.

To rotate certificates, follow one of the following procedures:

* If multiple CAs are expiring soon, see [Rotate All CAs and Leaf Certificates](#bulk-rotation).

* If the only certificates expiring are leaf certificates, see [Rotate All Leaf Certificates](#leaf-rotation).

* To only rotate a subset of CAs, see [Rotate a Single CA and Its Leaf Certificates](#single-rotation).

* To rotate the Services TLS CA, see [Rotate the Services TLS CA and Its Leaf Certificates](#services-rotation).

* To rotate CredHub Set Certificates, see [Rotate CredHub Set Certificates](#set-certificate-rotation).

<p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> All CredHub Maestro rotation commands have a dry-run flag that can be used to preview the certificates to be modified.</p>

### <a id='bulk-rotation'></a> Rotate All CAs and Leaf Certificates

This section describes the procedure for bulk rotating all CAs and leaf certificates using CredHub Maestro.

<%= vars.company_name %> recommends that you use the <%= vars.ops_manager %> API to perform bulk rotation of certificates unless you meet the conditions described in [When to Use CredHub Maestro for Certificate Rotation](#when-to-use).

<div class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> If any of your deployments use a Services TLS CA:
  <ul>
    <li>Run all CredHub Maestro commands except <code>maestro regenerate leaf</code> with <code>--exclude /services/tls_ca</code>.</li>
    <li>Run <code>maestro regenerate leaf</code> with <code>--exclude-signed-by /services/tls_ca</code>.</li>
  </ul>
The process for rotating the Services TLS CA requires additional steps to ensure that there is no downtime. To rotate a Services TLS CA, see <a href="#services-rotation">Rotate the Services TLS CA and Its Leaf Certificates</a>.</div>

To rotate all CAs and leaf certificates in CredHub:

1. Regenerate all CAs. This creates a new version of every CA. Run:

    ```
    maestro regenerate ca --all
    ```

1. Mark the latest version of each CA as transitional. This indicates that the certificate is inactive, so that all leaf certificates trust the new CA version. Run:

    ```
    maestro update-transitional latest --all
    ```

1. Redeploy:
    1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.
    1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
    1. On the **Review Pending Changes** page, enable the **Select All Products** checkbox.
    1. For each service tile you have deployed:
        1. Verify that the **Recreate all service instances** errand is disabled. You do not need to run this errand because when run by itself, CredHub Maestro does not update BOSH Agent certificates.
        1. Enable the **Upgrade all service instances** errand. Running this errand is necessary to push CredHub certificate updates to each service instance.
        <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The names of the <strong>Recreate all service instances</strong> and the <strong>Upgrade all service instances</strong> errands may be slightly different between services.</p>
    1. Click **Apply Changes**.

1. Mark the signing version of each CA as transitional by running:

    ```
    maestro update-transitional signing --all
    ```

1. Regenerate all leaf certificates by running:

    ```
    maestro regenerate leaf --all
    ```

1. Redeploy:
    1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.
    1. Click **Review Pending Changes**.
    1. On the **Review Pending Changes** page, enable the **Select All Products** checkbox.

### <a id='services-rotation'></a> Rotate the Services TLS CA and Its Leaf Certificates

This section describes the procedure for rotating the Services TLS CA and its leaf certificates.

Before you begin this rotation procedure, ensure that you have the following:

* Only one <%= vars.ops_manager %> foundation and not a multi-site or Wide Area Network (WAN) setup.
For a multi-site or WAN setup, you must perform the <bold>Apply Changes</bold> steps across all your sites or WAN.
* All certificates must include Subject Alternate Name (SAN) and Common Name (CN) entries.
* Your services are configured for high availability to minimize potential app impact during CA rotation. Rotating the Services TLS CA requires an upgrade all on-demand service instances, which can cause service downtime.
* Knowledge whether your deployment contains non-Java MySQL apps that rely on <code>VCAP_SERVICES</code> for TLS. You must rebind and restage these apps during the procedure, which can require additional time and coordination for the rotation. You do not need to rebind and restage MySQL apps that use <code>jdbcURL</code> or consume CA certificates from <code>/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificate.crt</code>. For more information about determining which apps are affected, see this [Knowlegebase Article](https://community.pivotal.io/s/article/Rotating-services-tls-ca-certificate-using-credhub-transitional-certificate-rotation-feature?language=en_US).

To rotate the Services TLS CA and its leaf certificates:

1. Check the [CredHub Maestro Tile Compatibility](maestro-tile-compatibility.html) document to ensure that all service tile versions currently deployed are compatible with Maestro.
    <p class="note warning"><strong>Warning:</strong> If you have any service tiles that are not compatible with CredHub Maestro, do not follow this procedure. If you do, you might experience extended downtime or data loss. Use the procedure documented in <a href="services_tls_ca_rotate.html">Rotating the Services TLS CA and Its Leaf Certificates</a> instead.</p>

1. Regenerate the Services TLS CA.
    1. On the Services TLS CA, see if your Services TLS CA was CredHub-set by running:

        ```
        maestro list
        ```
        After running this command, you see one Services TLS CA listed per deployment, but it is the same certificate.
    1. If the Services TLS CA was CredHub-set, run:

        ```
        maestro regenerate ca --name "/services/tls_ca" --force
        ```
        
1. Mark the latest version of the Services TLS CA as transitional by running:

    ```
    maestro update-transitional latest --name "/services/tls_ca"
    ```

1. Redeploy:
    1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.
    1. On the **Review Pending Changes** page, enable the **Select All Products** checkbox.
    1. For each service tile, enable the **Upgrade all service instances** errand.
       <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The name of the <strong>Upgrade all service instances</strong> errand may be slightly different between services.</p>
    1. Click **Apply Changes**.

1. For deployments that use MySQL for VMware Tanzu, rebind and restage all non-Java MySQL apps that rely on <code>VCAP_SERVICES</code> for TLS.

    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The bg-restage plugin enables zero-downtime blue-green restaging without access to the app source code. For more information, see <a href="https://github.com/orange-cloudfoundry/cf-plugin-bg-restage">bg-restage</a> on GitHub.</p>

1. Mark the signing version of the Services TLS CA as transitional.
Depending on your <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> version, do one of the following:
    - If you are on <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.9.3 or earlier, run:

        ```
        maestro topology --name /services/tls_ca
        ```

        Then, record the `certificate_id` and the `version_id` of the version with `signing: true` and run:

        ```
        credhub curl -p /api/v1/certificates/{certificate_id}/update_transitional_version -i -d '{"version": "{version_id}"}'
        ```
    - If you are on <%= vars.app_runtime_abbr %> v2.9.4 or later, run:

        ```
        maestro update-transitional signing --name "/services/tls_ca"
        ```

1. Regenerate all service instance certificates signed by the Services TLS CA by running:

    ```
    maestro regenerate leaf --signed-by "/services/tls_ca"
    ```

1. Redeploy:
    1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.
    1. On the **Review Pending Changes** page, enable the **Select All Products** checkbox.
    1. For each service tile, enable the **Upgrade all service instances** errand.
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The name of the <strong>Upgrade all service instances</strong> errand may be slightly different between services.</p>
    1. Click **Apply Changes**.

1. For deployments that use MySQL for VMware Tanzu, rebind and restage all non-Java MySQL apps that rely on <code>VCAP_SERVICES</code> for TLS.

1. Remove the transitional flag from the Services TLS CA. This removes the old, inactive version of the Services TLS CA on the next deployment. Run:

    ```
    maestro update-transitional remove --name "/services/tls_ca"
    ```

1. Redeploy:
    1. Return to the <%= vars.ops_manager %> Installation Dashboard.
    1. On the **Review Pending Changes** page, enable the **Select All Products** checkbox.
    1. For each service tile, enable the **Upgrade all service instances** errand.
    <p class='note'><strong>Note:</strong> The name of the <strong>Upgrade all service instances</strong> errand may be slightly different between services.</p>
    1. Click **Apply Changes**.

### <a id='set-certificate-rotation'></a> Rotate Manually Set Certificates

This section describes the procedure for rotating certificates that are manually set in Credhub.

To rotate a manually set certificate:

1. Create a new CA using the same parameters you used for the original CA.

1. Use the CredHub CLI or CredHub API to set the new CA at the same path as the original. To download and install the CredHub CLI, see the [CredHub CLI](https://github.com/cloudfoundry-incubator/credhub-cli) repository on GitHub. For more information about the CredHub API, see the [CredHub API documentation](https://credhub-api.cfapps.io/).

1. Mark the latest version of the single CA as transitional. This indicates that the certificate is inactive. Run:

    ```
    maestro update-transitional latest --name "CA-NAME"
    ```
    <p class="note"><strong>Note:</strong> The CA name you provide must be the full path to the credential.</p>

## <a id='garbage-collection'></a> Delete Inactive Certificate Versions

Over the course of many rotations, it is possible for the CredHub database to fill up. In order to prevent this, you can periodically use CredHub Maestro's garbage collect functionality to delete old, unused certificate versions.

You can run garbage collect on leaf certificates and CAs. Generally, deleting leaf certificates is enough to free up space in the database.

To see if you need to run garbage collect, do one of the following:

* Manually check the BOSH Director's VM vitals through your IaaS provider.

* SSH into the BOSH Director and run `df -h /var/vcap/store`.

<p class='note warning'><strong>Warning:</strong> To enhance the safety of the garbage collect command, CredHub Maestro only deletes versions of a certificate older than the currently active version. To delete all inactive versions of CAs or leaf certificates, add the <code>--force</code> flag to the garbage collect command. <%= vars.company_name %> does not recommend using the <code>--force</code> flag during a rotation.</p>

### <a id='leaf-cert-cleanup'></a> Delete All Leaf Certificates

To delete all leaf certificates:

1. Determine which certificate versions you want to delete by running:

    ```
    maestro garbage-collect leaf --all --dry-run
    ```

1. Delete the certificate versions by running:

    ```
    maestro garbage-collect leaf --all
    ```

### <a id='ca-cleanup'></a> Delete All CAs

To delete all CAs:

1. Determine which CA versions you want to delete by running:

    ```
    maestro garbage-collect ca --all --dry-run
    ```

1. Delete the CA versions by running:

    ```
    maestro garbage-collect ca --all
    ```

### <a id='single-leaf-cert-cleanup'></a> Delete a Single Leaf Certificate

    ```
    maestro garbage-collect leaf --name "LEAF-CERTIFICATE-NAME"
    ```

### <a id='single-ca-cleanup'></a> Delete a Single CA

To delete a single CA:

1. Determine which CA you want to delete by running:

    ```
    maestro garbage-collect leaf --name "CA-NAME" --dry-run
    ```
    Where `CA-NAME` is the name of the CA you want to delete.

1. Delete the CA by running:

    ```
    maestro garbage-collect leaf --name "CA-NAME"
    ```
    Where `CA-NAME` is the name of the CA you want to delete.
