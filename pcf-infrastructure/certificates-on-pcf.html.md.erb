This topic describes the sources and uses for certificates to secure both internal and external networking calls in <%= vars.product_name %>.


## <a id="sources"></a> Certificate Sources

Certificates in <%= vars.product_name %> originate from these sources:

* [Enterprise Root Certificate Authority (CA)](#enterprise-root-ca)

* [CredHub](#credhub)

### <a id="enterprise-root-ca"></a> Enterprise Root CA

An enterprise root CA is able to grant itself a certificate and create subordinate CAs. Domains require an enterprise root CA to allow clients to request certificates.

Generating certificates against a root CA is a good implementation for systems that are static and do not need highly available certificate creation.

### <a id="credhub"></a>CredHub

You can use CredHub as a source for certificates in <%= vars.product_name %>. These certificates can either be self-signed or signed by an imported trusted CA. Certificates are self-signed by default.

Use CredHub for:

* High availability
* Dynamic generation of certificates
* More secure communication between platform components, apps, and services

<%= vars.recommended_by %> recommends using CredHub for high availability and good security posture in <%= vars.product_name %>.

For more information, see [CredHub](https://docs.pivotal.io/platform/<%= product_info['local_product_version'].to_s.sub('.','-') %>/credhub/index.html).
